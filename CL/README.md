# The Command Line Task
I found :
 - what we can do with GUI we can do it with CL and more 
 - CL is more professional 
 - but the GUI is easier than CL
 - maybe after using CL a lot it will be easier and faster
 
 ### Some Commands about files
 - Making a Directory using (mkdir "DirectoryName") like new Folder
 - Removing a Directory using (rmdir "DirectoryName")
 - Creating a Blank File using (touch "Name.extenison")
 - Copying a File or Directory using (cp  <source> <destination>)
 - Moving a File or Directory using (mv <source> <destination>)
 - Removing a File (and non empty Directories) using (rm fileName or DirectoryName)
