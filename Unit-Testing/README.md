# Unit Testing

in C#, you can think of a unit as a method.
You thus write a unit test by writing something that tests a method.
Oh, and it tests something specific about that method in isolation.
Don’t create something called TestAllTheThings and then proceed to call every method in a namespace.


To create a Test Project 
  1. Right click on the solution to add a project.
  2. Choose the “Unit Test Project Template” after selecting “Test.”
  3. Name it anything
  4. create your test method

Tips:

   1. Think of reading the output of the test in the test runner
   2. Avoid Test Interdependence
   3. Make it simple
